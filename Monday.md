# New interests I'v discovered 
1. SceneKit 
    1. This would allow me to use models iv created in blender in my apps which allows me to have fun and use my game development skills 

2. WidgetKit 
    1. I feel like widgets should be more customisable and useful so Im going to look into making them more interesting. 

3. Japanese Literature (They have a different way of viewing common subjects ) 
4. Texture painting using blenders new painting system (this gives low res version of 3D models a  hi res look depending on how good you are at painting)

#  What Happened 
Im starting the 100 Days of swift again but this time trying to explore both UI and BackEnd, my aim with this is to keep shocking myself with new content. 

My goals with this is :
1. learn more about using the systems in depth 
2. Learn about what makes a good looking app 
3. Learn more about optimisation 
4. Figure out which skills Im missing in order to grow

- This is app UI i created

# Challenges 
-  I had a hard time creating my own version from this version 
- Cleaning up the code and encapsulating different aspects in files to make browsing the code more readable 
- I get stuck in a situation of trying to make it look identical and not making the app my own 
# Solutions
- Looking for reference to make this app feel like my own, by browsing pinterest to find my own style .
- Using a design pattern to clean up the code base and more scalable, refactoring the codebase will be a goal of mine
