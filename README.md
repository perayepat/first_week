## Solutions 
* I took my time going through the menu's to understand what some but not all the new features did. 
* To make something interesting i'v realised you need to put some dents in it (by dents I mean character and personality)

## New Found Features 
These are new things iv discovered about markdown 

* Markdown allows these following features :
	- Using html and css in your markdown file 
	- You can also create presentations 
	- Website creation 

In conclusion this is something else i want to get good at using and a useful too to have , markdown could have amazing compatibility with IOS and i can't wait to discover them.
